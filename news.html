     					<p>Many fans of Star Wars say they grew up with the films and have felt passionately about the universe for their whole lives. I know no one is exaggerating when they make that statement, but Tim Murphy’s daughter will have a unique perspective. She’ll grow up literally surrounded by and immersed in Star Wars. Tim designed her nursery to incorporate all sorts of elements from the galaxy far, far away. He first saw A New Hope when he was about five years old; he was totally blown away. He particularly remembers being hung up on the “silver C-3PO.” He didn’t realize until years later that was actually U-3PO. Fast forwarding into the future, Tim was excited to share his enthusiasm for Star Wars with his kid. I talked with him about the decorations, about getting recognition for the nursery from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, and more.

    			<strong><b>StarWars.com: </b>The Cloud City mural is gorgeous. How did you complete the project — did you sketch it out first and how long did it take you to complete?</strong><br>

				<strong><b>Tim Murphy:</strong></b> When we really thought we were having a boy, I had done some concept drawings for a Hoth mural <i>(Empire is my favorite movie in the saga)</i>, but now we wanted to steer clear of those blue tints because so many blue nursery accessories are geared towards boys. I wanted a pink nursery, but my wife made it clear that pink was off limits — but there could be pink accents. I made a drawing of a green mural based on Dagobah, but we very quickly decided that “swamp” was the wrong way to go for a baby’s room! In the meantime, we decided on teal and gray for the rest of the nursery. I went back to basics and tried to narrow down the most beautiful Star Wars locations. We pretty quickly settled on Cloud City since it satisfied all of our hopes — iconic Star Wars without a lot of explosions and fighting, using <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, and maybe even an opportunity to throw some pink in there! I started looking up paintings of clouds and different ways to paint a lot of different sunsets and sunrises. Then, I did a digital rendering on my computer. Once my wife was happy with it, I started painting! The clouds took about three hours. Then it took another hour or two to paint Cloud City and the Millennium Falcon.

   						<p><b>Adaptations play a big part in Star Wars history. They didn’t just retell the stories of the films. They featured deleted scenes. Named background characters. Had new dialogue. This article series explores some of these novelizations and comic adaptations, and how they deepened Star Wars.</b>

    			<br><strong>A New Hope</strong><br>
    			Released six months before the movie arrived in cinemas, there are many interesting things to note from this novel. But the most is probably the opening prologue, which basically tells us the entire story of the prequel trilogy way before those movies were even made. In hindsight, this prologue is very accurate to those movies, showing that George Lucas always did have the general ideas in place. While this prologue is also the first, and for a long time the only, mention of the Whills within the Star Wars universe, they recently were mentioned again in the prologue of The Force Awakens novelization which was a clear homage, due to both being written by the same author.

   					<p><i>Unbeknownst to most of the galaxy, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas ordered the creation of an army of clones for the Galactic Republic on Kamino. A decade later, the army would come to light, and Yoda deemed them worthy of aiding the Republic against the Separatist threat in what would become known as the Clone Wars. While the Jedi would command the clone troopers, the Grand Army of the Republic had ranks of its own. Let’s meet the captains and commanders that lead their troops into battle!</i>

    			<br>Commander <b>Appo</b> (CC-1119) joined the troopers of the 501st Legion as a sergeant, and fought under Jedi General Pong Krell on Umbara. He later climbed up the ranks and became commander of the 501st. After Palpatine issued <b>Order 66, Appo </b>joined Darth Vader in his march on the Jedi Temple, killing all the remaining Jedi inside. Commander Bacara (CC-1138) was given command of the 21st Nova Corps, also known as the Galactic Marines. He fought alongside Jedi General <b>Ki-Adi-Mundi</b> in the final battle of Mygeeto during the Outer Rim Sieges, when Order 66 was issued. Together with his Marines, Bacara shot down Mundi. Commander Blackout was a member of the special stealth operations unit, which was given command of an experimental stealth ship. While initially sneaking supplies through the blockade around Christophsis, Blackout had to engage the command ship of Admiral Trench. Commander Blitz was an Advanced Recon Commando and part of Rancor Battalion. He was stationed on Kamino to oversee clone trooper training. Commander Bly (CC-5052) was assigned to the 327th Star Corps, working closely with Jedi General Aayla Secura on missions from Lurmen to Alzoc III. During the Outer Rim Sieges he was with Secura on Saleucami, and shot her in the back after Order 66 was issued.
