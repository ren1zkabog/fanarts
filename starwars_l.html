            <p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Star Wars: The Clone Wars </b>is an American 3D CGI animated television series created by George Lucas and produced by Lucasfilm Animation with the division Lucasfilm Animation Singapore, Lucasfilm and CGCG Inc. The series debuted on the US version of Cartoon Network on October 3, 2008.<strong><u> It is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy during the three years between the prequel films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, the same time period as the previous 2D 2003 TV series Star Wars: Clone Wars.</u></strong> Each episode has a running time of 22 minutes to fill a half-hour time slot.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Characters & Casts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Matt Lanter as Anakin Skywalker</li>
                
              <li>Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka Tano</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Season 1</b> shows a wide variety of battles and adventures with Grievous and Dooku as the lead antagonists. Many of the episodes are stand-alone, but a common thread throughout the season is that the Republic and the Separatists attempt to convince various planets and races to side with them. In <b>Season 2</b>, the Sith resort to hiring bounty hunters and mercenaries to steal objects and intel or to assassinate targets for them. Meanwhile, the Jedi lead the Republic forces in an assault on the primary battle droid manufacturing facility.

            The first half of both <b>Season 3 and Season 4</b> are diplomatic in nature; Season 3, in particular, has many stories that take place away from the battlefield.
            <b>Season 5</b> is unique in that it consists of 5 four-part story arcs, 3 of which center on Ahsoka's character development. Meanwhile, the Separatists gain more ground, and the story of an old villain who has returned concludes. <b>Season 6</b> explores topics that are crucial in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, namely the creation of the clones and the details behind Order 66. Chancellor Palpatine gains even more power, and Yoda delves deeper into the nature of the Force.</p>

          <p>The saga begins with a child Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, being discovered by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who senses the boy's enormous potential. It is here that Skywalker first encounters the legendary Obi-Wan Kenobi, who himself is still but a pupil. As the first film unfolds, key characters appear, such as Padmé Amidala, R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda, and the villainous Sheev Palpatine, who is a mere Senator in the Galactic Republic at the time. After a debate with the Jedi Council, one which includes the possible resurface of the Sith in addition to Skywalker, it is decided that Anakin will not be trained as a Jedi. At the end of the film, the Sith, Darth Maul, leads an attack against the Jedi on Naboo, and only the tragic death of Qui-Gon at his hands persuades the Jedi to reconsider their decision. Anakin Skywalker then becomes Obi-Wan's apprentice in the ways of the Force.</p>
